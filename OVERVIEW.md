# Deploying a simple Web Application to Azure App Service (via Docker)

## Goals

1. Build a simple MVC application using the template in Visual Studio. Don't add any features
2. Dockerise it
3. Deploy it to app service
4. Set up automated pipeline from github to deploy on changes to master
5. Add features (database, perhaps a form ?) and demonstrate developing features
6. Demonstrate that the pipeline is working with something breaking tests and preventing deployment
7. Demonstrate that the pipeline is working by passing all checks and automatically containerising and deploying to azure. 
8. View the product online ! ðŸŽ‰

## Format

- A set of challenges is provided for devs to work on throughout the week (individual chalenges)
- Every day we can do a quick retro and have that inform a demo the following day (perhaps we do M/W/F to be more sustainable ?)

### Week 1
- Three ways

### Week 2
01 - Write a trivial web application.
02 - Get it running in a Docker container.
03 - Deploy it to App Service
04 - Set up a CI-CD pipeline to deploy from Github.
05 - Add small features to the trivial web application.
