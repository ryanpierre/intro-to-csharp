# Intro to programming in C#

## What are we doing here ?

We'll be learning the C# programming language, the ASP.NET web app framework, the Docker containerization platform, and the Microsoft Azure Cloud Service over the next 5 weeks.

We're hoping that by the end of this module you'll be able to:

- Build straightforward OO programs using C#
- Containerise and deploy a simple web application using Azure
- Use OO design principles to make sound programming decisions in everyday scenarios
- Build and deploy database-backed web apps using C#, ASP.NET, and Azure

## What will the next 5 weeks look like ?

- Every Monday, we will Kick off the week's subject at 10:30
- Every Monday and Wednesday we'll have a small retrospective to discuss what we're collectively struggling with at 15:00
- Every Friday we'll have a longer retrospective where we'll reflect on the week as a whole at 15:00
- Every Tuesday and Thursday we'll do a short demonstration together based on what we discussed on Mondays and Wednesdays retros. That will happen at 10:30
- Every day, from 10:30 - 1:00 will be coaching hours, where you can reach out for support and I'll be around.

The structure of the 5 weeks is as follows:

**Week 1** - Language basics of C# 
**Week 2** - CI/CD, Containers, and Azure basics
**Week 3** - Writing high quality OO code
**Week 4** - Writing web apps with ASP.NET
**Week 5** - Writing web apps with ASP.NET

This module will be quite a bit more independant than bootcamp was. We'll be working on individual challenges each week that are designed to keep you occupied for the week. You can always ask for help in the cohort channel or directly message a coach. It's recommended you try the cohort channel for help if you're comfortable, that way knowledge can be shared !
