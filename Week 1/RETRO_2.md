# Retro 2 

- Visual Studio is freezing a lot, can't write tests currently
- Exception test is not working 

## Collect things that aren't going well or are hard/challenging

- hard to learn a language by translation (how to navigate documentation and reputable sources for how to do things)
  - spend some time on self learning when it comes to really hard shit
  - because youre really gonna need that skill when it comes to azure / aws if you use it
  - *general rule of thumb* : prioritize as simple as possible without cutting corners
- Brain is working a lot harder because learning so much from scratch. Everything is new at once - its not just a new language its new ways of thinking about things
- Testing things feels simple in other languages and and way more complicated in C#
- Mocking - would be good to get a head start on it because it might be a challenge
  - Why do we mock ? How do we start to like it ?
- What constitutes behaviour vs implementation ? 
  - Why is there debate around this ?
- Interfaces <--- youre not going to be able to mock without understanding these.

## Demo tomorrow

- Interfaces
- Mocking
- Navigating resources
